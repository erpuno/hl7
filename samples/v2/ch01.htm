<h2>
<A NAME="Heading3">1.2 PURPOSE</A></h2>

<p>This
document contains the specifications for Version 2.4 of the Health Level Seven
(HL7) Standard for electronic data exchange in all healthcare environments,
with special emphasis on inpatient acute care facilities (i.e., hospitals). It
summarizes the work of a committee of healthcare providers (i.e., users),
vendors and consultants established in March 1987 on the occasion of a
conference hosted by Dr. Sam Schultz at the Hospital of the University of
Pennsylvania.  Its participants, who represent users as well as vendors, share
a common goal of simplifying the implementation of interfaces between computer
applications from different, and often competing, vendors.  This committee,
which subsequently became known as the HL7 Working Group, endeavors to
standardize the format and protocol for the exchange of certain key sets of
data among healthcare computer application systems.  Meetings are held
approximately every four months in scattered locations throughout the United
States.  HL7 sanctioned national groups also exist in many other countries
outside of the United States including Australia, Canada, China, Finland,
Germany, India, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Southern Africa, Switzerland,
Taiwan, The Netherlands, and the United Kingdom.<br>
This document is being presented to interested parties.  It is a status report
that is periodically published to solicit the involvement of the broadest
possible group of participants as this protocol is being put into use.
Comments are solicited on all aspects of the Standard.<br>
This effort is expected to yield a balloted standard that is open to <b>all</b>
who develop healthcare data processing systems.  As the Standard has been put
into production, experience has been gained and is reflected in this latest
revision.<br>
There have been two parallel efforts since the publication of Version 2.2.
First, Version 2.3 represents an evolutionary change over Version 2.2 that was
published in December 1994.  Version 2.3 is the result of more than two years
work, and thousands of hours of volunteer effort by active HL7 members since
the publication of Version 2.2.   Its primary goals include maintaining
backward compatibility with Version 2.2, correcting errors discovered after the
publication of 2.2, and extending the Standard within the format and context of
Version 2.2.<br>
HL7 is operating under formal bylaws and balloting procedures.  These
procedures are modeled on the balloting procedures of other relevant healthcare
industry computer messaging standards organizations (e.g., ASTM) and are
designed to conform to the requirements of the American National Standards
Institute (ANSI).  HL7 is participating in ANSI's Healthcare Informatics
Standards Board (HISB).  In June 1994, HL7 became an ANSI Accredited Standards
Developing Organization.  Version 2.2 of HL7 was accepted by ANSI as an
accredited standard in 1996 and HL7 Version 2.3 received ANSI approval in May
of 1997.  Version 2.3.1 received ANSI approval in April of 1999.  Version 2.4
is being submitted to ANSI for similar consideration.<br>
HL7, as an organization, has experienced significant growth over the last
several years.  Currently, HL7's membership consists of approximately 2000
members in all membership categories and regularly attracts 400-500 members and
non-members to each of its three yearly meetings.  As of 1998, HL7 had
documented several hundred healthcare provider organizations that have
implemented computer interfaces based on the HL7 Standard.  It is possible for
a healthcare provider institution to use HL7 without actually being an HL7
member through a member vendor or through outright purchase of the Standard
without joining HL7.
</p>

<h2>
<A NAME="Heading4">1.3 BACKGROUND</A></h2>

<p>The
term "Level 7" refers to the highest level of the Open System Interconnection
(OSI) model of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).  This
is not to say that HL7 conforms to ISO defined elements of the OSI's seventh
level.  Also, HL7 does not specify a set of ISO approved specifications to
occupy layers 1 to 6 under HL7's abstract message specifications.  HL7 does,
however, correspond to the conceptual definition of an application-to-
application interface placed in the seventh layer of the OSI model.<br>
In the OSI conceptual model, the functions of both communications software and
hardware are separated into seven layers, or levels.  The HL7 Standard is
primarily focused on the issues that occur within the seventh, or application,
level.  These are the definitions of the data to be exchanged, the timing of
the exchanges, and the communication of certain application-specific errors
between the applications.  However, of necessity, protocols that refer to the
lower layers of the OSI model are sometimes mentioned to help implementors
understand the context of the Standard.  They are also sometimes specified to
assist implementors in establishing working HL7-based systems.<br>
The HL7 Working Group is composed of volunteers who give their time on a
personal basis or under sponsorship of their employers.  Membership in the HL7
Working Group has been, and continues to be, open to anyone wishing to
contribute to the development and refinement of Level 7 Interface Standard for
network technology in healthcare.<br>
The Standard currently addresses the interfaces among various systems that send
or receive patient admissions/registration, discharge or transfer (ADT) data,
queries, resource and patient scheduling, orders, results, clinical
observations, billing, master file update information, medical records,
scheduling, patient referral, and patient care.  <b>It does not try to assume a
particular architecture with respect to the placement of data within
applications but is designed to support a central patient care system as well
as a more distributed environment where data resides in departmental systems.
Instead, HL7 serves as a way for inherently disparate applications and data
architectures operating in a heterogeneous system environment to communicate
with each other.</b><br>
If we consider the multitude of healthcare information systems applications as
well as the variety of environments in which healthcare is delivered, it is
evident that there are many more interfaces which could benefit from
standardization.  The interfaces chosen were considered to be of high priority
by the members participating in the standards writing process.  HL7's intent is
to prepare a complete standard for these interfaces, built on a generic
framework that is sufficiently robust to support many other interfaces.  This
Standard has been put into production and is being used as a basis for
extending the existing interface definitions and also adding other
definitions.<br>
It is expected that one result of publishing this specification will be the
recruitment of more Working Group members with special interest in some newer
and not yet fully specified areas.  Some of the areas that have already been
identified are:<br>
a)	decision support<br>
b)	additional specific ancillary departments<br>
c)	information needs associated with healthcare delivery systems outside of the
acute care setting<br>
The above notwithstanding, the Working Group members feel that the interfaces
addressed here are sufficient to provide significant benefit to the healthcare
community.<br>
This document is structured as follows.  The balance of this chapter contains a
rationale for developing the Standard, the goals of the Standard, and issues
that have been considered by the Working Group pertaining to scope and
operational approach.  It is hoped that this will help the readers understand
the basis for decisions that have been made in developing the Standard.
Subsequent chapters specify, respectively:<br>
a)	overall structure for all interfaces including a generalized query
interface<br>
b)	patient administration (admission, discharge, transfer and registration)<br>
c)	order entry<br>
d)	patient accounting (billing) systems<br>
e)	clinical observation data, such as laboratory results, that are sent as
identifiable data elements (rather than display oriented text)<br>
f)	a generalized interface for synchronizing common reference files (master
files)<br>
g)	medical information management<br>
h)	patient and resource scheduling<br>
i)	patient referral messages for referring a patient between two
institutions<br>
j)	patient care messages that support communication of problem-oriented
records, and to provide functionality for the implementation of clinical
pathways in computer information systems
</p>

<h2>
<A NAME="Heading5">1.4 NEED FOR A STANDARD</A></h2>

<p>The
organization and delivery of healthcare services is an information-intensive
effort.  It is generally accepted that the efficacy of healthcare operations is
greatly affected by the extent of automation of information management
functions.  Many believe that healthcare delivery agencies that have not
automated their information systems are not able to compete effectively in the
healthcare market of the 1990's.<br>
In the past two decades, healthcare institutions, and hospitals in particular,
have begun to automate aspects of their information management.  Initially,
such efforts have been geared towards reducing paper processing, improving cash
flow, and improving management decision making.  In later years a distinct
focus on streamlining and improving clinical and ancillary services has
evolved, including bedside (in hospitals and other inpatient environments) and
"patient-side" systems (in ambulatory settings).  Within the last few years,
interest has developed in integrating all information related to the delivery
of healthcare to a patient over his or her lifetime (i.e., an electronic
medical record).  It has also been envisioned that all or part of this
electronic medical record should be able to be communicated electronically
anywhere as needed.<br>
It is not uncommon today for the average hospital to have installed computer
systems for admission, discharge, and transfer; clinical laboratories;
radiology; billing and accounts receivable, to cite a few.  Often these
applications have been developed by different vendors or in-house groups, with
each product having highly specific information formats.  As hospitals have
gradually expanded information management operations, a concomitant need to
share critical data among the systems has emerged.  Comprehensive systems that
aim at performing most, if not all, healthcare information management are in
production by selected vendors.  These systems may be designed in a centralized
or a distributed architecture.  Nevertheless, to the extent that such systems
are truly complete, their use would mitigate the need for an external data
interchange standard such as HL7.<br>
There are, however, many pressures on an institution to develop or acquire
individual departmental applications on a modular basis.  One source of such
pressure is the special departmental needs that may not be addressed well (or
perhaps at all) by a comprehensive vendor (i.e., so called "best-of-breed").
Another is the need to evolve the overall systems environment of a hospital
through a series of incremental, departmental decisions rather than in a
single, revolutionary acquisition.  These pressures could be met by an
environment containing a comprehensive system supplemented by departmental
systems, or one consisting entirely of separate and discrete systems.<br>
Network technology has emerged as a viable and cost-effective approach to the
integration of functionally and technically diverse computer applications in
healthcare environments.  However, these applications have developed due to
market structure rather than through a logical systems approach; they are
therefore often ad hoc and idiosyncratic.  At the very least, they do not
possess a common data architecture and their combined data storage actually
constitutes a highly distributed and severely de-normalized database.
Extensive site-specific programming and program maintenance are often necessary
for interfacing these applications in a network environment.  This occurs at
considerable expense to the user/purchaser and vendor while often keeping
vendor staff from other initiatives such as new product development.  The need
for extensive site-specific interface work could be greatly reduced if a
standard for network interfaces for healthcare environments were available and
accepted by vendors and users alike.<br>
Finally, the lack of data and process standards between both vendor systems and
the many healthcare provider organizations present a significant barrier to
application interfaces.  In some cases, HL7 becomes an effective template to
facilitate negotiations between vendors and users but cannot, by itself, serve
as an "off-the-shelf" complete interface.<br>
In summary, it is important that both vendors and users not be faced with the
problem of supporting incompatible transaction/communications structures.
Instead, a framework must be developed for minimizing incompatibility and
maximizing the exchange of information between systems.  It is proposed that
HL7 can act as a superstructure in this environment to facilitate a common
specification and specifications methodology.  It is indeed both practical and
economical to develop, and commit to, standard interfaces for computer
applications in healthcare institutions. 
</p>

<h2>
<A NAME="Heading6">1.5 GOALS OF THE STANDARD</A></h2>

<p>The
specifications of this Standard were developed in accordance with <b>a
priori</b> specified goals.  Future extensions of the Standard should also
support these goals.<br>
HL7's purpose is to facilitate communication in healthcare settings.  The
<b>primary goal</b> is to provide standards for the exchange of data among
healthcare computer applications that eliminate or substantially reduce the
custom interface programming and program maintenance that may otherwise be
required.  This primary goal can be delineated as a set of goals:<br>
a)	the Standard should support exchanges among systems implemented in the
widest variety of technical environments.  Its implementation should be
practical in a wide variety of programming languages and operating systems.  It
should also support communications in a wide variety of communications
environments, ranging from a full, OSI-compliant, 7-level network "stack" to
less complete environments including primitive point-to-point RS-232C
interconnections and transfer of data by batch media such as floppy disk and
tape.<br>
b)	immediate transfer of single transactions should be supported along with
file transfers of multiple transactions.<br>
c)	the greatest possible degree of standardization should be achieved,
consistent with site variations in the usage and format of certain data
elements.  The Standard should accommodate necessary site-specific variations.
This will include, at least, site-specific tables, code definitions and
possibly site-specific message segments (i.e., HL7 Z-segments).<br>
d)	the Standard must support evolutionary growth as new requirements are
recognized.  This includes support of the process of introducing extensions and
new releases into existing operational environments.<br>
e)	the Standard should be built upon the experience of existing production
protocols and accepted industry-wide standard protocols.  It should not,
however, favor the proprietary interests of specific companies to the detriment
of other users of the Standard.  At the same time, HL7 seeks to preserve the
unique attributes that an individual vendor can bring to the marketplace.<br>
f)	while it is both useful and pertinent to focus on information systems within
hospitals, the long-term goal should be to define formats and protocols for
computer applications in all healthcare environments.<br>
g)	the very nature of the diverse business processes that exist within the
healthcare delivery system prevents the development of either a universal
process or data model to support a definition of HL7's target environments.  In
addition, HL7 does not make a priori assumptions about the architecture of
healthcare information systems nor does it attempt to resolve architectural
differences between healthcare information systems. <b> For at least these
reasons, HL7 cannot be a true "plug and play" interface standard.</b>  These
differences at HL7 sites will most likely require site negotiated
agreements.<br>
h)	a primary interest of the HL7 Working Group has been to employ the Standard
as soon as possible.  Having achieved this, HL7 has also developed an
infrastructure that supports a consensus balloting process and has been
recognized by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) as an Accredited
Standards Organization (ASO).<br>
i)	cooperation with other related healthcare standards efforts (e.g., ACR/NEMA
DICOM, ASC X12, ASTM, IEEE/MEDIX, NCPDP, etc.) has become a priority activity
of HL7.  HL7 has participated in the ANSI HISPP (Health Information Systems
Planning Panel) process since its inception in 1992.
</p>

<h2>
<A NAME="Heading7">1.6 HISTORY OF HL7 DEVELOPMENT</A></h2>

<p>The
HL7 Working Group has met approximately every three to four months since March
1987 to develop and review this specification.  The group is structured into
committees to address each of the functional interfaces under development, with
additional committees to address the overall control structure and various
administrative aspects of the group.  These committees have the responsibility
to author and maintain the chapters in the HL7 Interface Standard.  In
addition, from time to time various special interest groups are formed within
HL7 to develop ideas and sponsor particular perspectives that are not covered
by any single existing committee.  If a special interest group's activities
warrant and a new chapter is considered necessary, they may petition the HL7
Technical Committee Chair and the Executive Committee to form a Technical
Committee.<br>
In the initial three meetings, a Version 1.0 draft Standard was prepared
covering the overall structure of the interfaces, ADT, order entry, and
display-oriented queries.  Although the patient accounting system was
recognized as very important, the time frame did not allow it to be addressed
in the first draft.  This draft was presented to a Plenary meeting of the
overall group in Tyson's Corner, VA, on October 8, 1987. <br>
Version 2.0 was prepared subsequent to Plenary I in Tyson's Corner and
presented at Plenary II in Tucson in September 1988.  Since Plenary II, editing
and revisions for Version 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.3.1, and 2.4 have been ongoing and
the Working Group has grown to nearly 400 individuals, far exceeding its
original size of 12 and the following has been accomplished:<br>
a)	specifications for the various functional areas have been refined and
expanded.<br>
b)	formal liaison was developed with several other standards efforts: the ANSI
HISPP (Healthcare Information Standards Planning Panel) for the coordination of
healthcare standards efforts that has since been replaced by the ANSI HISB
(Healthcare Information Standards Board), the ASC X12N group for external EDI
Standards, the ASTM E31.11 group for Clinical Data Exchange Standards, the
ACR/NEMA DICOM group for standards relating to imaging and other aspects of
Radiology Information Systems, and the IEEE P1157 group for medical data
interchange (MEDIX).<br>
c)	the generic control structure was modified, on the basis of comments, to be
adaptable to a wider variety of communications environments and to facilitate
cooperation with other standards groups.<br>
d)	a chapter on the interface to a patient accounting system has been added.<br>
e)	a chapter on the reporting of ancillary results, clinical trials, product
experience and waveform data has been prepared, harmonized with the ASTM
1238-91 Standard and with the direct, active participation of members of the
ASTM E31.11 committee.<br>
f)	a chapter with a set of transactions to support the synchronization of
master files between related information systems has been added.<br>
g)	a chapter on the interface to applications that support medical record
functions including transcription management, chart location and tracking,
deficiency analysis, consents and release of information.<br>
h)	a chapter on messages to support the communication of various events related
to the scheduling of appointments for services or for the use of resources has
been added.<br>
i)	a chapter defining the message set used in patient referral communications
between mutually exclusive healthcare entities has been added.<br>
j)	a computerized data dictionary of all data elements and other message
components has been created.  Appendix A contains cross references and other
information generated from this electronic data dictionary.<br>
k)	inconsistencies and mistakes which were discovered in the previous Versions
2.0, 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 of the Standard have been addressed and documented in
Version 2.3.1.<br>
l)	extensive additions have occurred in the Order/Entry and Clinical
Observations chapters to include data element oriented results, pharmacy orders
and administrations interface.<br>
m)	message acknowledgments have been extended to include a separate enhanced
mode that defines the "accept acknowledgment."  While this mode of
acknowledgment has always been allowed, it is now obvious how HL7 supports any
environment when intermediaries exist in the network with implicit time delays
(such as store and forward services, "Interface Engines" that perform fan out
services, etc.).  Immediate acknowledgments are available to release the
sending system from the need to resend the message.<br>
n)	distinctions have been documented between the HL7 abstract message
definition which is purely a level 7 (application level) definition vs. the HL7
encoding rules for converting an abstract message into a string of characters
that comprises an actual message.  These encoding rules are actually a
suggested potential alternative where a fully defined level 6 (presentation
level) definition does not exist (e.g., ISO's ASN.1 Basic Encoding Rules (BER)).
</p>

<h2>
<A NAME="Heading8">1.7 OVERVIEW</A></h2>

<p>This
section contains a description of the conceptual basis of the HL7 Standard, the
approach to accommodating intra-site variations and evolutionary changes, and
the way it has been structured in order to accommodate varying current and
future communications environments.
</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading9">1.7.1 HL7 encoding rules </A></h3>

<p>Message
formats prescribed in the HL7 encoding rules consist of data fields that are of
variable length and separated by a field separator character.  Rules describe
how the various data types are encoded within a field and when an individual
field may be repeated.  The data fields are combined into logical groupings
called segments.  Segments are separated by segment separator characters.  Each
segment begins with a three-character literal value that identifies it within a
message.  Segments may be defined as required or optional and may be permitted
to repeat.  Individual data fields are found in the message by their position
within their associated segments.<br>
All data is represented as displayable characters from a selected character
set. The ASCII displayable character set (hexadecimal values between 20 and 7E,
inclusive) is the default character set unless modified in the MSH header
segment.  The field separator is required to be chosen from the ASCII
displayable character set.  All the other special separators and other special
characters are also displayable characters, except that the segment separator
is the ASCII Carriage Return character.<br>
(1)  There is nothing intrinsic to HL7 Version 2.4 or ASTM 1238 that restricts
the legal data set to the printable ASCII characters.  The former restriction
was imposed to accommodate the limitations of many existing communication
systems.  Some existing systems would misinterpret some eight-bit characters as
flow control characters instead of data.  Others would strip off the eighth
bit.<br>
(2)  The European community (EC) has a need for printable characters (for
example, the German oe, the French accent grave) that are not within the
above-defined restricted data set.  The personal computer market accommodates
these alphabetic characters by assigning them to codes between 128 and 256, but
it does this in many different ways.   ISO 8859 is a 256-character set that
does include all of the needed European letters and is a candidate for the
European standards group.  Where the Europeans define an eight-bit character
set specification, HL7 will accept this data set in environments that require
it, and can use it without complications.<br>
(3)   Multi-character Codes:<br>
(a)  UNICODE - When communicants use UNICODE, and all characters are
represented by the same number of bytes, all delimiters will be single
characters of the specified bytes length, and the Standard applies just as it
does for single-byte length, except that the length of the characters may be
greater than one byte.<br>
(b)  JIS X 0202 - ISO 2022 provides an escape sequence for switching among
different character sets and among single-byte and multi-byte character
representations.  Japan has adopted ISO 2022 and its escape sequences as JIS X
0202 in order to mix Kanji and ASCII characters in the same message.  Both the
single- and multiple-byte characters use only the low order 7 bits in JIS Kanji
code with JIS X 0202 in order to ensure transparency over all standard
communication systems.  When HL7 messages are sent as JIS X 0202, all HL7
delimiters must be sent as single-byte ASCII characters, and the escape
sequence from ASCII to Kanji and back again must occur within delimiters.  In
most cases the use of Kanji will be restricted to text fields. <br>
There are other parts of the JIS X series that support Katakana (JIS X 0201/ISO
IR 13), Romaji (JIS X 0201/ISO IR 14) and Kanji (JIS X 0208/ISO IR 87) and JIS
X 0212/ISO IR 159) that can be used in HL7 messages in the same manner as JIS X
0202.<br>
(c)  In the case that a single country uses conflicting rules for representing
multi-byte characters, it is up to the communicants to ensure that they are
using the same set of rules.  <br>
The encoding rules distinguish between data fields that have the null value and
those that are not present. The former are represented by two adjacent
quotation marks, the latter by no data at all (i.e., two consecutive separator
characters.)  The distinction between null values and those that are not
present is important when a record is being updated.  In the former case the
field in the database should be set to null; in the latter case it should
retain its prior value.  The encoding rules specify that if a receiving
application cannot deal with a data field not being present, it should treat
the data field as present but null.<br>
The encoding rules specify that a receiving application should ignore fields
that are present in the message but were not expected rather than treat such a
circumstance as an error.  For more information on fields and encoding rules,
see Section 2.6, "Fields," and 2.10, "Message Construction Rules."
</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading10">1.7.2 Local variations</A></h3>

<p>The
HL7 Standard is intended to standardize data interchanges, not the underlying
applications systems.  This means that there will be a wide variety in the
manner in which the Standard is applied in different institutions.<br>
The requirement to support diversity within the Standard is addressed in these
ways:<br>
a)	The only data fields that are required in the abstract messages are those
necessary to support the logic of the relationships among the messages or their
basic purpose.  Many other fields are specified but made optional.<br>
b)	There are provisions within the specifications to add messages or portions
of messages that are local to an institution. The conventions used for this are
intended to prevent conflict with future versions of the specification.
</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading11">1.7.3 Evolutionary changes to the standards</A></h3>

<p>All
standards must evolve as the applications they support change and as a result
of experience using them.  In recognition of this, the Standard includes a
protocol version ID in all messages.<br>
New transactions or data elements will be added to operational HL7 environments
as a result of changes in the Standard or due to changes in the local
implementation as permitted within the Standard.  It is important that these
changes be implementable at a site without requiring all communicating
applications to upgrade simultaneously.  The special provisions in the Encoding
Rules for dealing with fields that are not present or unexpected are very
important here.  Because of them, new fields can be added first to the sending
or source system; the receiving system will ignore the new fields until it has
been updated to use them.  Often, these rules also facilitate changing the
receiving system first.  Until the sending system is changed, the receiving
system will find the new data field `not present' and deal with this according
to its rules for data not present.<br>
Similarly, the HL7 Encoding Rules support changes in data field sizes.  Fields
are found within the message by examining separators, rather than by an offset.
Changing the size of a field does not change the procedure used to detect
subsequent fields.
</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading12">1.7.4 Applicability to file transfers (batch processing)</A></h3>

<p>Although
the HL7 Standard is defined in terms of the client-server (remote operation)
model, its standards are equally applicable to file transfers.  One or more
messages may be encoded according to the Encoding Rules, grouped in a file and
transferred using external media, FTAM, FTP, Kermit, or any other file transfer
protocol.  Responses may be grouped in a file and similarly transmitted.
Chapter 2 provides the general mechanisms for the batch transmittal of HL7
messages.
</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading13">1.7.5 Relationship to other protocols</A></h3>

<p>A
great deal of consideration has been given to the relationship between the HL7
Standard protocol and other protocols.  There are three questions:<br>
a)	what is the relationship between the HL7 protocol and "lower layer," service
protocols?  In strict accordance with the ISO OSI model, HL7 should not
replicate features of these protocols.  This can even be construed to require
HL7 to avoid replicating certain ISO layer 7 functionality contained in the
Service Elements.<br><br>However, it is the goal of the HL7 group to support
healthcare communications in a wide variety of communications environments,
including many that are not as complete as ISO will be one day.<br>
b)	what is the relationship between the HL7 Standard protocol and other
applications protocols?  Protocols of interest include the ASC X12 Standards
for Electronic Document Interchange, the ASTM 1238-88 Standards for laboratory
data reporting, the ACR/NEMA DICOM Standards for imaging and other aspects of
Radiology Information Systems, and the IEEE P1157 Standards for Medical Data
Interchange (MEDIX).<br>
c)	what is the relationship between the HL7 Standard and various proprietary
healthcare protocols in use today?</p>

<h4>
<A NAME="Heading14"> </A></h4>


<h4>
<A NAME="Heading15">1.7.5.1 Lower layer protocols</A></h4>

<p>The
HL7 Encoding Rules are substantially different from the ASN.1 Basic Encoding
Rules (BER) documented in CCITT X.409 and X.209 and ISO 8825 or those employed
in LU6.2 or RPC.  This is because:<br>
a)	by definition, the HL7 encoding rules will be applied where the environment
does not include software to do encoding.  Without such software, the burden on
applications programmers to develop messaging software that conforms to those
encoding rules is onerous.<br>
b)	the encoding rules of these protocols depend on the assumption that lower
level protocols provide transparency (i.e., all character codes can be
transmitted without being changed by and of the lower levels).  This assumption
is often not met in the communications environments that must serve HL7 for the
interim.  The techniques that might be used to implement transparency in the
Lower Level Protocol are difficult to implement in some present-day
applications environments.<br>
The notation chosen to document the message formats in the HL7 Standard is not
the Abstract Syntax Notation1 (ASN.1) Basic Encoding Rules (BER) defined by
ISO.<br>
Contrary to other high level communications environments, there is no notion of
association separate from the sending of the message from client to server and
the response.  This seems appropriate to the client-server model.<br>
Whenever HL7 is applied in a networking environment, addressing will be an
issue.  This is equally true when it is applied on ISO Standards networks or
proprietary networks.  Although the Standard does not specify how this
addressing will occur, it does provide certain data fields that will be of
value in determining addresses.  The fields <i>MSH-5-receiving application</i>,
<i>MSH-6-receiving facility</i>, and <i>MSH-11-processing ID</i>, are located
in the header of all HL7 messages.  <i>MSH-6-receiving facility</i> is intended
for environments where multiple occurrences of the same application are being
run on the same computer system or on the same network on behalf of different
institutions or other organizational entities. <i>MSH-11-processing ID</i> is
used where various versions of essentially the same application may reside on
the same computer for different purposes.  See<i> HL7 table 0103 - Processing
ID</i> for recommended values.<br>
HL7 does not standardize all values for <i>MSH-5- receiving application</i>
and<i> MSH-6-receiving facility</i> at this time because there are so many
variations in place in existing systems and because different kinds of
environments (e.g., different countries) may have different required code sets.
However, we strongly encourage the use of the HL7 suggested code sets where
they are defined and we recognize that movement toward more standardized codes
is essential for seamless communications.
</p>

<h4>
<A NAME="Heading16">1.7.5.2 Other application protocols</A></h4>

<p>The
Working Group has given considerable attention to the relationship of the HL7
protocol and other protocols.  A considerable liaison effort is underway.  This
is described below:<br>
<u>a)	ACR/NEMA DICOM.</u>  The HL7 Working Group maintains an on-going liaison
with the ACR/NEMA DICOM working group.  HL7 and ACR/NEMA DICOM are both members
of ANSI's HISB.<br>
<u>b)	ASC X12 Standards for Electronic Document Interchange.</u>ASC X12 is a
family of standards that provides both general and specific descriptions for
data interchange within a number of industries. The HL7 Encoding Rules are
modeled on the X12 standards, although there are differences.  The HL7 Standard
needs to accommodate online exchange of individual transactions on LANs. This
difference, and certain applications issues, is responsible for the variance
from X12. X12 has recently decided to follow the UN/EDIFACT encoding rules for
all X12 standards produced in 1995 or later.  X12N transactions that facilitate
the transfer of healthcare claims and remittance information as well as benefit
coordination, enrollment and verification are enjoying dramatically increased
use.  HL7 has elected to assume that all new business transactions between
institutions regarding the interchange of claims, benefits, or other financial
information are the responsibility of ASC X12N, the insurance subcommittee of
X12.<br><br>In February of 1994, HL7 and X12 signed an agreement to "improve
coordination efforts and have identified that technical issues must be
harmonized.  Both groups agree to migrate to the appropriate level of
resolution of potentially overlapping work by utilizing user and standards
communities' and anticipated healthcare reform requirements."<br><br>
<u>c)	ASTM 1238.94 Laboratory Data Reporting.</u>  An active liaison effort
between the ASTM committee and the Working group has resulted in minor changes
in the ASTM specification to enhance compatibility, changes in the HL7 control
specifications to enhance compatibility, and the development of the entire
Ancillary Data Reporting chapter, developed jointly by the committees and built
on the ASTM Standards.  This liaison has extended to the point where both
groups now have the permission to freely use the contents of each others
standards efforts "in whole" within their own published standards.<br><br>Some
distinctions are more in the terminology chosen than the actual message
content.  For example, the ASTM "sub-field delimiter" is generally used to
separate repetitions of homogenous values.  It is called a "repetition
separator" in HL7.  HL7 and ASTM are both members of ANSI's HISB.<br>
<u>d)	IEEE P1157 ("MEDIX").</u>  The MEDIX committee has defined an
application-level protocol similar in scope to HL7 but built strictly on the
ISO protocol stack, up to and including the Remote Operation Service Element
(ROSE).  HL7 varies from this approach by the decision not to depend on ROSE
nor use the ASN.1 BER syntax notation.  Despite the difference in approaches,
the HL7 Working Group has regular liaison with the MEDIX committee.  The
Working Group has devised a format for the HL7 Standard that is relatively
independent of the encoding rules chosen and easily translated into the ASN.1
notation.  The transactions defined in this manner should be directly
transferable to the MEDIX effort, and transaction messages encoded using the
HL7 scheme should be translatable to transactions encoded using the BER.  This
should facilitate the creation of gateways between the HL7 and future
environments.<br>
In addition, HL7 and MEDIX have agreed on a course for convergence.  This will
occur within the HL7 abstract message definitions.  MEDIX has further agreed to
use the HL7 abstract message definitions as defined in Version 2.1 as a
starting point for the MEDIX message definitions.<br>
HL7, IEEE, and X12 are ANSI approved standards developers. 
</p>

<h2>
<A NAME="Heading17">1.8 THE SCOPE OF HL7</A></h2>

<p>It
is useful to understand both what HL7 is and what it is not.  This chapter, up
to this point, represents some effort to give the reader an overall
understanding of HL7 by looking at purpose, history, and some of its overall
features and architecture.  It is also of value to understand the "edges" or
limitation of HL7.  While HL7 can, and routinely does, provide a considerable
service in everyday use today, there are certainly many areas of healthcare
system integration that HL7 does not address or addresses with what may prove
to be an inadequate or incomplete solution.<br>
Many of these topic areas are being worked on today by HL7 and will, hopefully,
appear in latter versions of this balloted Standard.  Some others of these
topics may never be addressed by HL7 because they are being addressed by some
other standards body.  Still other areas may never be addressed by HL7 due to a
lack of interest, or at least available energy by its members.<br>
In any case, it is certainly useful for the analyst to understand what these
boundaries are and to then either choose to solve them in some other way or to
merely ignore them if they are deemed not sufficiently important.  The
following features listed in this section may well be best served by the
participating applications themselves.  However, it is possible to conceive of
an architecture that expects these features to be present in the messaging
standard itself.  These potential deficiencies are included to give the reader
a complete view.
</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading18">1.8.1 A complete solution</A></h3>

<p>HL7
is not, in itself, a complete systems integration solution.  The issue directly
addresses the so-called goal for "plug-and-play."  There are several barriers
in today's healthcare delivery environment that make it difficult, it not
impossible, for HL7 to create a complete "plug-and-play" solution.  Two of
these barriers include: a) the lack or process conformity within healthcare
delivery environments and b) the resulting requirement for "negotiation"
between users and vendors.<br>
There is little, if any, process conformity within healthcare delivery
environments.  As a consequence, healthcare information solutions vendors are
required to create very flexible systems with a very wide range of data and
process flow options.  HL7 attempts to address the superset of all known
process (i.e., trigger) and data (i.e., segment and field) requirements.  In
doing this, it has attempted to be "all things to systems and users."<br>
In fact, there is no one user nor any system that users would elect to use that
would use all that HL7 attempts to offer.  This "excess" of features typically
requires some level of "negotiation" to take place between a user and his/her
vendors to come up with the set of triggers and data items necessary to affect
the solution for the user.  In effect, this creates a unique use of the
Standard at that site.  The current version of HL7 has no intrinsic way to
tailor a pre-determinable view of the Standard for each possible use.  Future
versions of HL7 will likely address this shortcoming.<br>
A true integrated healthcare information systems solution addresses an
integrated database, or at least what appears to be a virtual integrated
database.  In fact, however, as a practical matter, information solutions still
need to be installed and operated in environments where no other, or only a
subset of other, systems are available.  In any case, all systems today are
designed and implemented to process using their own local copies of data.<br>
HL7, to this date, has not attempted to prescribe the architecture,
functionality, data elements or data organization of healthcare applications.
Rather, HL7 has attempted to accommodate all application requirements that have
been brought to its attention by volunteers willing and able to address
them.<br>
Future versions of HL7 may choose to alter HL7's historic approach to these
issues.  Recent efforts by HL7 and other ANSI Standards Developers to produce
Data Meta Models have created a framework that both standards and applications
developers can use as a common basis for defining and using both data and data
organizations.  Widespread acceptance of these concepts may allow HL7 and other
Standards Groups to be more prescriptive in their approach with a smaller set
of choices that must be made when interfaces are implemented.<br>
For now, however, users should be aware that HL7 provides a common framework
for implementing interfaces between disparate vendors.  In all cases, if an
existing application interface is not available, HL7 reduces (but does not
eliminate) the time and cost required to implement an application interface
between two or more healthcare information systems.  If a user chooses to
implement a set of homogeneous solutions from a single vendor, HL7 is typically
not necessary nor even applicable.
</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading19">1.8.2 Protection of healthcare information</A></h3>

<p>HL7
Version 2.4 is largely silent about the issues of privacy authentication and
confidentiality of data that pass through HL7 messages.  HL7 makes no
assumption about the ultimate use of data but rather assumes that both source
and destination applications provide for these requirements.  In addition, HL7
does not, at this time, specifically specify what, if any, encryption method
should be used when transporting HL7 -based messages between two or more
systems.  At this time, HL7 users should familiarize themselves with legal and
professional requirements for these topics.
</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading20">1.8.3 Department of Defense (DOD) requirements for systems security and robustness</A></h3>

<p>HL7
Version 2.4 does not attempt to support DOD Security Divisions (A, B, C, D) and
Classes (1, 2, 3).  If a user requires these features, they will have to define
their own structures to support these classifications and insure a uniform
implementation across multiple systems in an enterprise.
</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading21">1.8.4 Enforcement of organizational security and access control policies</A></h3>

<p>HL7
Version 2.4, itself, does not provide for the enforcement of a provider
organization's security and access control policies.  There are no messages
specifically defined, at this time, that affect the movement of data based on
an organization's security and access control policies in conjunction with
message content information that identifies the users of the message data and
the organization's policies for that user's authorization to access that data.
Systems implementors may want to reference relevant ASTM standards and IOM
recommendations on this topic.
</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading22">1.8.5 Security classifications (markings) and users authentication and identification</A></h3>

<p>HL7
Version 2.4 does not, at this time, attempt to address DOD requirement for
marking or access control labels that are associated with data objects.  This
particular method might be one way of supporting both IOM and JCAHO
recommendations for providing different levels of data confidentiality and
authentication of both producers and consumers of confidential data.
</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading23">1.8.6 Roles and relationships</A></h3>

<p>HL7
Version 2.4 does not, in itself, attempt to define or even support the implicit
and explicit relationships between persons such as patients, physicians,
providers, etc.  It is possible that current data modeling efforts by HL7 and
other standards developers will, in the future, result in HL7 assuming this
responsibility.
</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading24">1.8.7 Accountability, audit trails and assigned responsibility</A></h3>

<p>HL7
Version 2.4 does not attempt to define typical transaction processing features
such as audit trails.  A feature such as an audit trail may well be needed to
successfully implement both a robust and security auditable environment.  This
feature could also support verifying that a given action is performed by
individuals who are also responsible.  A user may decide that these features
are necessary in their integrated environment.
</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading25">1.8.8 Central, unified hardware, software controls for security and trusted continuous protection</A></h3>

<p>HL7
Version 2.4 does not attempt to support hardware and software security
controls, nor does it provide means to insure continuous protection of data
from unauthorized changes.  Such a feature may be useful in limiting access to
certain types of data to devices and/or users, based on device type or
location.  Certain DOD requirements and IOM recommendations may required users
to implement these on their own and/or rely on specific applications vendors to
support this requirement.
</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading26">1.8.9 Uniform data definition and data architecture</A></h3>

<p>HL7
Version 2.4 does not include an explicit data model or composite data
dictionary.  However, extensive work has taken place within the HL7 Working
Group to produce a data model for Versions 2.2 and 2.3.  While these models
have not been formally balloted, they are available on the HL7 web server.
Future versions of HL7 may also include a balloted data model and composite
data dictionary.
</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading27">1.8.10 Controlled disclosure, notification of disclosed information as protected and tracking exceptions of protected health information</A></h3>

<p>HL7
Version 2.4 is silent on supporting the controlled disclosure of protected
health information where HL7 is the vehicle of the disclosure across multiple
systems in a healthcare delivery system.  It is also silent on messages that
notify a user that requested information is protected and messages to track
allowed exceptions that may take place at the discretion of potentially, but
not certified, authorized users (e.g., a physician in the emergency room).
</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading28">1.8.11 Tracking of corrections, amendments or refusals to correct or amend protected health information</A></h3>

<p>HL7
Version 2.4 does not provide messages to support the tracking of corrections,
amendments or refusals to correct or amend protected health information.  These
messages would support the process to verify, challenge and ultimately correct
inaccuracies discovered in protected health information.  Users needing such
messages may need to define custom messages to support this requirement.
</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading29">1.8.12 Disclosure of disidentified health information</A></h3>

<p>HL7
Version 2.4 does not have specific messages to disclose "disidentified" health
information.  Disidentified data is data that does not reveal the identity of
the person or care provider(s) (either organizations or individual licensed
practitioners or both).  While it may be possible to support this need with
existing HL7 messages, it would create an unexpected message with missing
required patient identification.
</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading30">1.8.13 Ensuring and tracking data source authentication and non-alterability</A></h3>

<p>While
HL7 Version 2.4 does support an electronic signature for chart completion
transactions, it does not, in general, support an electronic signature that is
also tied to relevant applications to insure the authentication of the source
or arbitrary health data and a prohibition against the alteration of data that
has been electronically signed.
</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading31">1.8.14 Tracking input validation</A></h3>

<p>HL7
Version 2.4 does not provide messages for tracking the validation (or lack of
validation) of data from its source (human or machine).
</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading32">1.8.15 The longitudinal health record</A></h3>

<p>HL7
Version 2.4, itself, is silent on the actual logical and physical construction
of the patient longitudinal health record.  While it is certainly possible to
build the currently-identified major components of such a record using existing
HL7 messages, there is no formal attempt on the part of HL7 to define just what
the exact message sequence and content should be to describe this record.
Other organizations such as ASTM, CPRI and the IOM have published on this
subject.  It is not the intent of HL7, at this time, to formally define message
sequences and structures to directly create the longitudinal health record
across multiple information systems within (or outside of) a healthcare
delivery system.
</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading33">1.8.16 Integration of the health record</A></h3>

<p>HL7
Version 2.4 is silent on messages to support the integration of a patient's
health record across multiple delivery entities (or outside of) a healthcare
delivery system.  This would also include messages to insure central control
and integrity of information that was "merged" between multiple delivery
entities.
</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading34">1.8.17 Data, clock synchrony</A></h3>

<p>While
HL7 Version 2.4 makes significant use of time and date stamped data, it does
not support a set of transactions to insure that synchronization of the
electronic clocks with the various computer systems of the enterprise's
heterogeneous computing environment.
</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading35">1.8.18 Intersystem database record locking and transaction processing</A></h3>

<p>HL7
Version 2.4 makes no attempt to provide messages that could support the
coordination of database activities across multiple information systems in a
heterogeneous computing environment.  Users who want to operate their multiple
systems as a distributed database environment must provide their own message
support or rely on a database vendor's facilities (e.g., Oracle, Sybase, etc.).
</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading36">1.8.19 Operations, process and other "local" support</A></h3>

<p>As
stated in Section 1.8.2, "Protection of healthcare information," above, process
and operations variations are a primary barrier to HL7 providing a complete
solution.  Serious attempts are being made to give HL7 the ability to support
operations and process variability in a future revision.  At this time,
however, (Version 2.4), operations and process variability is a major reason
why HL7 is implemented in a slightly different form at each and every site.
This includes issues such as business and clinical practice rules, clinical and
operation processes, staging and continuity of process steps, protocols,
resource/utilization requirements, quality assurance requirements, cost
management, comprehensive master file and code tables, etc.
</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading37">1.8.20 Interface engines</A></h3>

<p>The
so-called Interface Engine has grown into a popular implementation and
operation tool for HL7 and other message-based interfaces over the last several
years.  Interface engines, per se, however, are not an a priori consideration
in the design of HL7.  HL7 makes no assumption about the existence of an
Interface Engine at a particular HL7 site.  Hence, there also are no defined
HL7 messages to directly communicate with and control the operations of
Interface Engines.  This might be of particular use when the Interface Engine
assumes an applications architecture role as a dynamic filter and arbitrator of
information based on dynamic rules defined by delivery systems.
</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading38">1.8.21 Rules engines</A></h3>

<p>As
a close practical application of an Interface Engine in the topology of
healthcare interfaces, rules engines are becoming increasingly popular.  HL7
does not have, at this time, specific messages to define and control the rules
that might be dynamically associated with an Interface Engine.  This might
include, but is not limited to: Create and modify patient therapeutic or
diagnostic protocols; Activate clinical or operational processes (e.g.,
conditional orders, critical paths, etc.); Cancel or hold active clinical
processes; Notify appropriate users of a state or condition.
</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading39">1.8.22 Infrastructure based applications</A></h3>

<p>A
number of applications and information delivery methods exist within the
healthcare delivery environment that can be closely identified with the
"infrastructure" that ties together disparate systems.  These applications
include, but are not limited to:<br>
	Robust and Integrated Scheduling<br>	Point of Service Support<br>	Prompts
Alerts and Reminders<br>	Concurrent Data Surveillance, Metrics and Analysis<br>
Concurrent Decision Support<br>	Outcome Tracking<br>	Tracking of Patient (i.e.,
customer) Expectation and Satisfaction<br>	Problem Lists<br>
These, and probably others, could be well served by the use of healthcare data
during and very close to the action of transferring information between
healthcare information systems.  HL7, at this time, has very little or no
message functionality that directly supports these uses of healthcare data.
</p>

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading40">1.8.23 Support for secondary clinical records</A></h3>

<p>HL7
Version 2.4 does not provide specific messages to support partial replication
(i.e., extraction and subsequent merger) of a patient's demographic and
clinical records.  This process has been identified by the IOM, JCAHO and
others as an emerging requirement for the maintenance and practical use of an
electronic health record system.  HL7 may provide more explicit support for
this concept in the future as organizations such as ASTM and CPRI develop
specific definitions and requirements for this functional activity and
healthcare vendors start to include this type of functionality within their
individual clinical record solutions offerings.
