basic level of definition within HL7 is that of the abstract message associated
with a particular trigger event.  The abstract message definition includes the
data fields that will be sent within a message, the valid response messages,
and the treatment of application level errors or the failure of the underlying
communications system.  An HL7 abstract message is defined in terms of HL7
segments and fields, as described in Section 2.4.8.

College of Radiology and the National Electrical Manufacturers Association.
The American College of Radiology formed a relationship with the National
Electronic Manufacturers' Association in 1982 to develop a standard for Digital
Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM).  The purpose of the standard
was to promote a generic digital image communication format; facilitate the
development and expansion of picturing archiving and communication systems
(PACS); allow the creation of diagnostic information databases for remote
access; and help assure the useability of new equipment with existing systems.
The current standard (Version 3.0) defines image data as well as patient, study
and visit information necessary to provide the context for the images.
Approval of this document as an American National Standard may be pursued in
the future by NEMA, which is accredited by ANSI.

HL7 Standard is written from the assumption that an event in the real world of
health care creates the need for data to flow among systems.  The real-world
event is called the trigger event.  For example, the trigger event "a patient
is admitted" may cause the need for data about that patient to be sent to a
number of other systems.  There is a one-to-many relationship between message
types and trigger event codes.  The same trigger event code may not be
associated with more than one message type.
